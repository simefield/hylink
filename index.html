        <h2>What is HyLink<sup>™</sup></h2>
        <p class="lead">HyLink<sup>™</sup> is a <span class="u-textNowrap">New Zealand</span> innovation to improve the efficiency and flexibility of renewable energy systems.</p>
        <p>HyLink<sup>™</sup> combines a rugged electrolyser, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, with a low pressure hydrogen storage system.</p>
        <p>HyLink<sup>™</sup> provides a method to store energy when it is available (e.g. when the sun shines on PV panels) in the form of a clean fuel gas, hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen burns to produce heat and pure steam. A range of hydrogen fuelled appliances are being developed, including instant hot water heaters, barbecues and cooking hobs.</p>

        <h2>Energy – more than electricity!</h2>
        <p class="lead">We use energy in many forms to provide the services we need for our lifestyle. On average more than 70% of household energy is used as heat; either for producing hot water, cooking or space heating.</p>
        <p>The conventional way to store renewable energy is in batteries, and these are ideal for meeting electrical loads, e.g. lights, TV etc. However battery systems are not suited to provide heat in a short time, e.g. for cooking, so LPG gas is often used to provide heat for people living off the power grid.</p>
        <p>LPG is a non-renewable, carbon-based fuel that produces CO<sub>2</sub> when it burns.</p>
        <p>HyLink<sup>™</sup> offers an entirely renewable system with the power and convenience of gas, but with no carbon footprint and no need to reorder and collect replacement LPG cylinders.</p>

        HyLink<sup>™</sup> Hydrogen
        Energy System
        <h2>Renewable Energy Systems</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy is better than fossil fuels, especially on islands where the fuel needs to be transported from the mainland. Where energy is needed, everybody should be trying to make use of the local sustainable resources. Wind and solar energy are readily available on this island and throughout <span class="u-textNowrap">New Zealand</span>, as well as many other remote locations around the world.</p>

        <h2>Energy Storage</h2>
        <p>The problem with intermittent energy resources such as wind and solar is how to store their energy efficiently until it is needed. Hydrogen gas made from water is a simple way of storing some of this energy, particularly if the end use is heating and cooking. A device to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity is called an electrolyser. This technology is designed to cost effectively produce and use hydrogen effciently.</p>

        Matiu/Somes
        Island pilot system
        <h2>The Hydrogen Energy Equipment</h2>
        <p>This is a pilot site set up to evaluate the performance of the <span class="u-textNowrap">New Zealand</span> developed hydrogen system called HyLink<sup>™</sup>. Here on Matiu/Somes Island hydrogen is made from water using surplus wind and solar electricity.</p>
        <p>The hydrogen is stored in a plastic pipe under the ground at low pressure (up to four times atmospheric pressure), where it can be kept for months with negligible loss.</p>
        <p>At present the hydrogen gas is being used to fuel a barbeque and provide instant hot water in the workshop. It is possible to extend the use of this clean fuel to substitute LPG on other parts of the island. It can also be used for regeneration of electricity via a fuel cell.</p>

        <h2>About Hydrogen</h2>
        <p>Hydrogen is a very light, colourless, odourless gas. It rises and disperses rapidly in air. It burns intensely even in small concentrations and produces a very hot, colourless flame without any carbon dioxide emissions. Fuel cell vehicles use tanks at a pressure of up to 700 atmospheres, and it must be compressed to high pressure for this application. However, for stationary storage, researchers have developed the low pressure system using standard cost effective polymer fuel pipes. The hydrogen is produced directly at the storage pressure, so that no compression is required.</p>
